# Process

Webmaker design is process oriented. We create living documents and tools that respond to the needs of our users at the present moment in time. Our process aligns with the Webmaker team Heartbeats. Refer to *build.webmaker.org* for top, short-term priorities and longterm plans. 

#### Non-linear

Key elements of the process are outlined below. While this is not a fixed, linear process, all projects should touch on the elements below. Iteration allows us to circle through them and, in the [inspiring words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGmfiKowrYU) of Kang, "move forward, not backward; upward, not forward; always twirling, twirling, twirling towards ~~freedom~~" a free and open web.


## Start

Each stage of our process supports the following goals: 
 - Understand what people need
 - Address the whole experience, from start to finish
 - Make it simple and intuitive
 - Design using iterative practices
 - Add a dash of levity or even whimsy to provoke interest

## Problems

Webmaker design begins with a problem, almost always one for users. The problem should be clearly defined _before_ any work begins so that we can develop a hypothesis for a solution and use our work to it. Big problems should be broken into smaller problems so that we can iterate more easily toward the solutions.  


## Kickoff

Our heartbeats begin with a kickoff. This is our best chance to define the scope of the project and gather its parameters. By the end of this meeting, we should be able to articulate the problem and the types of solutions that might be suitable. 

_Are there existing theories on what might solve the problem?_ Find out. _Are there technical challenges that might limit your design? Does the scope feel too large or the problem too vague?_ Push back. _Are there people outside of the team you might consult for inspiration?_ 

We squeeze as much insight as possible from the engineers and stakeholders to set ourselves up for success.  


## Iterate

Our design process is iterative. We iterate as we move form idea to production. We continue to iterate afterward, as the things we make prove to work well (or not) with users.


## Ideation

Solving a problem begins with ideation. Ideation usually happens best with low-fidelity sketches. Fat markers help us avoid the impulse to be fiddly. Ideation is often successful when we bounce between working with a group and working quietly alone. 

Time spent on ideas is a _luxury_ and a _necessity_. We carve out space for it accordingly.  


## Talk to users

Research is an essential component to good design. We talk to users often to truly understand their problems. We talk to users outside formal user testing (described below) to gather unexpected insight.


## Benchmarks

We research benchmarks and precedents to make our work efficient and effective. _Don't rebuild the wheel. Stand on the shoulders of giants!_ We carve our own path, but do it informed by the state of the art. We share screenshots of benchmarks on [Redpen](http://redpen.io) to gather input from our peers. 


## Prototypes

Ideas are often best expressed as prototypes. Prototypes allow us to examine an idea to see where it succeeds and where it breaks. Prototypes should be iterative, and only include the level of fidelity required to test the idea. Paper prototypes often reveal problems with less pain than prototypes built with perfect pixels and code. Lo-fi prototypes can easily be made click-able and tap-able with tools like [popapp.in](http://popapp.in) and [marvelapp.com](http://marvelapp.com). In later iteration, high fidelity, pixel-perfect mockups are a chance to test whether the original idea is expressed in alignment with Webmaker's voice and brand before we move to production.


## UX, UI, IxD

_User Experience, User Interface, Interaction Design_

Prototypes often cycle from idea, through UX, to UI and IxD. These categories are interdependent and often overlap. Prototypes often work best when they don't try to tackle everything at once, but they shouldn't create artificial borders between these attributes of a product.


## User tests

Tests can be difficult, but their value is immeasurable. 

### Quantitative Tests

Quantitative tests are great at revealing whether or not something works. We use [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) to understand our visitors and their behavior, and to identify parts of their experience that are broken or hugely successfully. These are *descriptive* metrics. Funnels track users through a flow and are more *diagnostic*.  [Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com/) allows us to run diagnostic A/B tests. These are particularly useful for testing small adjustments because they can yield rock-solid statistics on the results that indicate the significance and confidence of the numbers. This is important because patterns that align with our assumption can accidentally lead to conclusions that are simply not true. Analysis can remove coincidence and noise. 

### Qualitative Tests

Qualitative tests are great at revealing _why_ something doesn't work. We run these tests with a small pool of individuals (3-5 often work well) between iterations to watch them in action and hear their observations. These tests can be done in person or remotely on [Usertesting.com](http://Usertesting.com). We test with people in our community and outside of it, conscience of how the participants' relationship to our work impacts their perspective. 

### Other Tests

Click tests, surveys, product stubs and many other methods can also help test a theory. Choose the right test for the job. 

User testing is an art that requires practice. At first, they often reveal more about the test itself than the thing you're testing. Persist! It gets better. 


## Feedback

**Get feedback**: Designers should not work in a bubble. We gather feedback early and often to gain insight on your design. We enable the best feedback by clearly framing our prototypes. 

> _What problem are we trying to solve? What research have we considered? What's the scope of the project? What's the status of your iteration?_ 

We answer these questions to help avoid uninformed and inefficient feedback. Show your process to demonstrate things you have considered, but found to be ineffective. 

**Give feedback**: Designers should not work in a bubble. We give feedback on each other's work to support everyone's projects and develop our own skills. 
 - We are kind, but not shy about giving negative, constructive feedback.
 - We are timely and informed of the context so we do not disrupt the process.  
 - We are mindful to distinguish our personal taste from our evaluation of quality. 
 - We recognize the importance of sharing positive feedback to identify the often elusive qualities that make a design good. 


## Design Review

On our team, we look to each other to provide perspective on our work, to make sure we stay aligned with the principles outlined in this handbook. This is formal feedback. _Is our work accessible? Does it support our brand?_ We review each other's work during weekly critiques, in [Redpen](http://redpen.io), and in [Github](http://github.com) issues. We request feedback early and often. In Github, @mention someone to formally request a review. Sometimes, we receive a deluge of feedback from people across the organization and beyond. We must accept _and filter_ the feedback to maintain quality and coherence. 


## Design QA (Quality Assurance)

In a Webmaker Heartbeat, each top priority project (P1) will have a someone assigned to QA. This person decides whether work is ready to be shipped or not. If Design Review is timely and thorough, Design QA will likely focus on the implementation of the design by the engineer. 


## Hand-off

Good design leads to great products when assets are given to engineers with clear notes on implementation. It's a big task to translate mockups into code that works across browsers and devices. 
 - We involve the engineer early and often so that our ideas don't lead to surprising blockers during implementation. 
 - We make their job easier by sharing files and notes in an organized manner. We often use *Dropbox*, *Github*, and *Redpen* for this task, though none of these tools are perfect for the job. 
 - Our Mockups include highly visible notes on them. 
 - Our comments in Github include lists with checkboxes for important details. 
 - We do not rely on Redpen comments, email, IRC, or other channels to communicate nitty-gritty details to an engineer.


## Assets  

Some projects yield assets that will be useful in future projects. We currently collect these on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B_rbDAen9prkS0N4MXRqaGo4bEE&usp=sharing). This collection should include perennial items like logos, fonts, and icons. These files should be prepared for reuse by others. This repository should not collect clutter that might never be used by the team again.
