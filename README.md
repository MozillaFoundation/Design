# Mozilla Foundation Design

The Mozilla Foundation Design team encompasses a group of highly multidisciplinary makers. We love everything design, from research to code, colours to typography, and branding to app UIs. We strive for our work to reflect an open source ethos, striving for and promoting an open and honest relationship with the world around us.

We spend a lot of our energy promoting web literacy. We’ve been hard at work the past year building innovative tools, supporting communities, teaching, learning, and shaping the environments in which the open web is made possible. We want everyone in the world to create, not just consume, the Web around them.

The Mozilla Foundation design team is located in Vancouver, Portland, Toronto, and Paris, Ontario. We all hang out on [IRC](https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC) in the #mofodesign channel. The wider Mozilla network of designers can generally also be found in #fistbump (visual design) and #ux.

We’d love to meet you – [email us to say hi](open-design@mozillafoundation.org)!

## Design Principles

We are currently working on documenting the design values we would like to guide us as a team. Want to see the work that’s happening? Take a look [here](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/Design/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3AP1+moodboard). We are presently searching the wild for inspiration around how these principles manifest as designs, and then as a team we will gather, discuss and document our final agreed upon principles.

## Process

Design at the Mozilla Foundation is process-oriented. We create living documents and tools that respond to the needs of our users at the present moment in time. Our process aligns with the wider Foundation team [Heartbeats](http://book.webmaker.org/heartbeats.html).

Each stage of our process supports the following goals:

- Understand what people need
- Address the whole experience, from start to finish
- Make it simple and intuitive
- Design using iterative practices
- Add a dash of levity or whimsy to provoke interest

Take a look at our [full Process](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/Design/wiki/Process). If you have any suggestions on improvements, we’re always eager to hear.

## Information Architecture
Foundation work focuses on these primary hubs: Advocacy, Learning Network, Science Lab, and Open News. As well as new initiatives: Internet of Things and Women & Web Literacy. These hub have common themes going through them: Leadership, Campaigns, Fellowships, Convenings, Communication, Tools, Resources and Community Members. This IA stucture helps dictate where content should live and what the URL should be. The themes also highlights opportunities to bridge across the hubs and work together. Take a look at this [chart] (http://bit.ly/MoFo-IA) for a summary.

## How to Work With Us

We love working with contributors from all around the world. As an contributor, you will be immersed in the world of products such as Thimble, communities such as Mozilla Learning Networks and Mozilla Hive groups, and initiatives such as Mozilla Advocacy and Fundraising.

During your time with us, you will learn how to:

- Approach design through an iterative process with our growing user base and community
- Design and implement interfaces and collateral work for our products and initiatives
- Illustrate collateral work for our products and initiatives
- Create and conduct user testing research to generate insights of our products
- Prototype and implement work using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Of course, you don't need to do it all. Even if you wish to focus on one discipline of design, or tackle just one small issue, we would love to have you on board. If you'd like to introduce yourself, one easy way is to [file an issue in this repo](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/Design/issues/new) so we can learn more about you – tell us what you would like to work on with us!

### Community Design at all of Mozilla

All of Mozilla is open! In our [Community Design Repository](https://github.com/mozilla/community-design), you can find design tasks across all of Mozilla and our communities, ready for you to tackle.

## Resources

If you are working with us as a contributor, we have created [a set of templates and guides](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0ByIoeeW0a3R_UjEzdDU4NlMzYXc&usp=drive_web) to help make it easier for you to get started. We have a collection of Toolkits, UI Guides, and Annotation Templates ready for you to use. You can find many more resources available at [https://build.mozillafoundation.org/design](build.mozillafoundation.org/design).

Of course, we would love to walk you through this content ourselves, if that's helpful. [Give us a shout](mofo-design@mozillafoundation.org) and a member of our team can set up a call with you.
