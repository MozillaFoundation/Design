# Mozilla Foundation Design

The Mozilla Foundation Design team encompasses a team of highly multidisciplinary makers. We love everything from research to code, colours to typography, and branding to apps. We strive for our work to be reflective of the ethos of open-source. As designers, we promote and strive towards an open and honest relationship with the world around us.

We spend a lot of our energy promoting web literacy. We’ve been hard at work the past year building innovative tools, supporting communities, teaching, learning, and shaping the environments in which the open web is made possible. We want everyone in the world to create, not just consume, the Web around them.

The Design team is located in Vancouver, Portland, Toronto, and Paris, Ontario. We’d love to [meet you](mofo-design@mozillafoundation.org).

## Our Values

We are currently working on creating values we believe encompass us as a team. Want to see the work that’s happening? Take a look [here](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/Design/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3AP1+moodboard). We are presently searching for ideas in the wild before we gather and discuss if they are reflective of our team.

## Process

Design at the Mozilla Foundation is process oriented. We create living documents and tools that respond to the needs of our users at the present moment in time. Our process aligns with the wider Foundation team Heartbeats.

Each stage of our process supports the following goals:

- Understand what people need
- Address the whole experience, from start to finish
- Make it simple and intuitive
- Design using iterative practices
- Add a dash of levity or even whimsy to provoke interest

Take a look at our [full Process](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/Design/wiki/Process). If you have any suggestions on improvements, we’re always eager to hear.

## How to Work With Us

We love working with contributors from all around the world. As an contributor, you will be immersed in the world of products such as Thimble, communities such as Mozilla Learning Networks and Mozilla Hive groups, and initiatives such as Mozilla Advocacy and Fundraising.

During your time with us, you will learn how to:

- Approach design through an iterative process with our growing user base and community
- Design and implement interfaces and collateral work for our products and initiatives
- Illustrate collateral work for our products and initiatives
- Create and conduct user testing research to generate insights of our products
- Prototype and implement work using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Of course, you don't need to do it all. Even if you wish to focus on one discipline of design, we would love to have you on board. File an issue so we can learn more about you; tell us what you would like to work on with us.

### Community Design

All of Mozilla is open! In our [Community Design Repository](https://github.com/mozilla/community-design), you can find design tasks across all of Mozilla ready for you to tackle.

## Templates and Guides

If you are working with us as a contributor, we have created [a set of templates and guides](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0ByIoeeW0a3R_UjEzdDU4NlMzYXc&usp=drive_web) to make your on boarding experience a bit more welcoming. We have a collection of Toolkits, UI Guides, and Annotation Templates ready for you to use. Of course, we would love to walk you through this content ourselves. [Give us a shout](mofo-design@mozillafoundation.org) and a member of our team can set up a call with you.
